# Inkwell for Android

> **Experimental** — Android companion to [Inkwell for iOS](https://github.com/ewanc26/inkwell). The iOS version is the primary client. This is a work-in-progress toward feature parity.

A native reader and writer for the [Standard.site](https://standard.site) publishing ecosystem on AT Protocol. Built with Jetpack Compose, Material 3, and Kotlin.

## Features

- **Read** — Fetches `site.standard.publication` and `site.standard.document` records from the author's PDS. Three-tab layout (Read / Discover / Write). Renders Leaflet blocks and Markpub/Offprint/pckt markdown.
- **Discover** — Searches the Standard.site public index. Cross-repo comment discovery via Constellation. Paginated feed with prev/next navigation.
- **Write** — Publishes Standard.site documents with portable metadata and selectable content formats.
- **AT Protocol Native** — OAuth with your AT Protocol handle (no app password). Session restores silently on relaunch.
- **Verification** — Publication `.well-known` and document `<link>` checks. Background notification polling via WorkManager.

## Relationship to Inkwell iOS

| | iOS (primary) | Android (experimental) |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift | Kotlin |
| UI | SwiftUI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Navigation | NavigationStack | Navigation Compose |
| Networking | URLSession + OAuthenticator | OkHttp |
| Serialization | Codable | kotlinx.serialization |
| DI | @Environment | Hilt |
| Background | BGAppRefreshTask | WorkManager |
| Status | Production-ready | Experimental |

Both share the same AT Protocol data model shapes, Constellation cross-repo discovery pattern, theme resolution cascade, and three-tab structure.
